# Metasploitable Series
## Issue 4 : CUP 1.7

Cups is a *Common Unix Printing System*. We can find the web in 192.168.199.130:631

I started searching online but couldnt find anything that I could understand so i went to my terminal and typed 'msfconsole' when Metasploit finally loaded I typed 'search CUPS' and i found an exploit. The exploit requires me to know the CUPS http password and http username.

I decided to do something firt to learn more about the users
