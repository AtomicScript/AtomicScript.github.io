# Metasploitable Series 
## Episode Introduction

The goal of this series is to exploit each services that the Metasploitable 3 offers and develop an exploit using python to automate that.
This will help me improve in exploiting linux systems, services, and web services. 

The instalation of Metasploitable 3 took me long to do but a small tip would be to set up vagrant in a directory with enough storage and add it to system vairable enviroemnt.
