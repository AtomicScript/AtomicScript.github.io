# OhSINT
## Are you able to use open source intelligence to solve this challenge?

After joining the room I downloaded the image and used *exiftool* to extract the metadata information.

I found GPS lats and long, and copyright: *OWoodflint*; Searched the user and found their *twitter, github and wordpress*

From twitter i found their *BSSID*: B4:5D:50:AA:86:41;

Then i used *wigle.net* to find the city they live in and the SSID: UnileverWiFi

from his *github* i found the city they are from twitter and gmail

from his *wordpres* i found where he has gone on holiday. I used first View Page source but couldnt find anything so i used inspect and found in the body a text that was in white it must be the password(pennYDr0pper.!)

>> tool used: exiftool, wigle.net, google search engine
