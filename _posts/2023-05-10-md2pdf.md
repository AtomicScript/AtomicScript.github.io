# MD2PDF
## Code injection 

tool used: **Nmap**

# Scanning
I used nmap to scan the ip address and i found something interesting 'rtsp' which is **Real-Time-Subscribe** wire protocol.

>Note to yourself. Always scan the url to make sure no hidden directories are created

```bash
#Gobuster Command:

nmap -sV [ip]

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  rtsp
5000/tcp open  rtsp
```

# Getting the key  
After spending hours trying to understand how code injection works, messing around with different codes and decoding the pdf response i gave up and looked at the guide.
Turns out I missed the /admin page which has a message that only localhost:5000 can see it. Meaning that the page I am using to convert to pdf can see it so all i have to do is craft the '<iframe>' that frames the localhost:5000/admin page/directory. With that I recieved the flag.
