# Security+ Part 2
> First step in getting certified

## My Study Approach
Since the last post, my study approach did not change. I would wake up and study for 30 minutes every weekday and one hour+ for the weekend. I still feel unsure about my progress and feel like I don's fully understand everything. For this reason, I will write a post on each topic I had an issue with to research and write what I understood and learned. Due to time limitation, I have skipped chapter 12 and will add it in the future. 

## Issues
I have a problem understanding RAID 

## Mistakes 
After studying the second chapters of Security+ below are my notes/mistakes:
1. **differential** backup captures the changes since the last *full* backup while the **incremental** backup captures the changes since the last backup.
2. **Warm sites** don't have the live data 
3. **Air Gap** prevents network connectivity 
4. **Mantrap** is also called access control vestibules
5. **MSP** provide information technology as a service to their customers, and **MSSP** provides security monitoring, vulnerability management, incident response, and firewall management. 
6. **Hypvervisor I** resides on top of the hardware but **Hypervisor II** runs as an app on top of an existing OS.
7. **MFP**(printer) has weak encryption as a security concern 
8.**HSK** used to secure and manage hardware key and PKI tool in a very small form factor.
9. **Geofencing** used to create a boundary 
10. **PEAK** authenticates using TLS tunnel. **EAP-FAST** focuses on reauthentication. **EAP-TLS** has a certificate management challenge, so **EAP-TTLS** extends it to remove the need to have a certificate to create a secure session.
